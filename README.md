# ARC_PLOT
First GPU plotter focus on Consumer hardware, with Network Ram Disk setup.

vision:
Plotting should be green use less engery, cheap or spare haredware.
ARC_PLOT is unique as it's the first plotter which take GPU and NetworkRamDisk( NRD ) to plotting community.

1. Plot architecture.

As a full ram based green plotter, arc_plot can be deployed as a cluster topology. there are two major component, the high-end plotting PC and the low end network ram disk (NRD) pc.
For high end plotting PC, more core and high freq ram is prefered. For NRD pc, 2 or 4 core , cheap ddr3 or 4 ram 128G to 256G preferred.

Plotting pc connecting to NRD with thunderbolt 4 or 10G nic, running ethernet network. Plotting PC mount remote ram disk as a network blocking devices. and multiple those devices was build a raid0.
