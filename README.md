# ARC_PLOT
First CPU + GPU plotter focus on Consumer hardware, with various topology.

vision:
Plotting should be green use less engery, cheap or spare haredware.
ARC_PLOT is unique as it's the first plotter which support CPU + GPU plotting.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Plot architecture.

Arc_plot can run in differrent topology.

a.) standalone 32G ram + 256 SSD

b.) standalone with 128G ram + 128G ssd

c.) NRD 128G x2 pc + standalone 32G ram.

d.) combine with GPU in standalone plotter.

please check wiki for details.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Release notes.
v0.5 Add "-R" mode, which is full 110G ram plotting without ram disk.

v0.6 Add "-G" mode, which is GPU plotting for phase1.

GPU plotting how to:

requirements:

hardware:

6 core cpu with 128G ram,  nvidia 10 series plus GPU with 8G vram. 

Software:

ubuntu 22.04.

3. Benchmark.

you can download the arc_plot and try it with this network ram disk prototype. it's still alpha, but your feedback is very valuable.
please submit your benchmark by a github ticket

Special thanks to MadMax and Bladebit as arc_plot learned lots of good design from them and here show highly respect for these complicated project and pioneer's hardwork.

ARC_PLOT is freeware and if you like this idea and love the arc_plot freeware, please don't forget donate some XCH to support this project.
